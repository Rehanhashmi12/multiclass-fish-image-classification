# üêü Multiclass Fish Image Classification


## üìå Project Overview
- This project focuses on classifying fish images into multiple categories using **Deep Learning**. 
- We built a **custom CNN from scratch** and experimented with multiple **pre-trained models** (Transfer Learning) to identify the best-performing architecture for accurate predictions.  
- The **best model** in this project was **MobileNet**, which achieved the highest evaluation scores without fine-tuning.

## üéØ Objectives
- Classify fish images into their correct categories.
- Compare the performance of a CNN and multiple pre-trained models.
- Deploy a **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions.
- Provide a **comparison report** with evaluation metrics.


## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset contains images of fish across multiple categories.

Images were preprocessed and augmented before training.

**Data Preprocessing & Augmentation:**
- Resizing all images to `224x224` pixels.
- Normalizing pixel values to range `[0, 1]`.
- Augmentation techniques:
  - Random rotation
  - Width and height shifts
  - Horizontal flips
  - Zooming
 
## ‚öôÔ∏è Approach

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ CNN Model
- **Architecture Summary:**
  - Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
  - MaxPooling layers for spatial reduction
  - Fully connected Dense layers
  - Softmax output for classification
- Trained from scratch to establish a baseline.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Transfer Learning Models
We used **ImageNet pre-trained models** for feature extraction:
- **MobileNet** ‚úÖ (Best Performing Model)
- VGG16
- ResNet50
- InceptionV3
- EfficientNetB0

> Note: **No fine-tuning** was performed ‚Äî only the top layers were trained while keeping the base model frozen.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Training Parameters
- **Epochs:** 20 (varied for different models)
- **Batch size:** 32
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Learning rate:** 0.001
- **Loss function:** Categorical Crossentropy
- **Evaluation metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

| **MobileNet** | **XX%**  | **XX%**   | **XX%**| **XX%**  |


## üñ•Ô∏è Deployment
A **Streamlit application** was developed to allow users to upload a fish image and get real-time classification results from the trained model.

**Run locally:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
